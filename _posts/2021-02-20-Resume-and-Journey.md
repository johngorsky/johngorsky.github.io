I'm working to get more info posted to the site; things I've learned and things that will hopefully be helpful to others. Currently I'm working my way through a Python course on Udemy and reading Pro Git. If you'd like to learn a bit more about me, click on Pages in the navigation links and you'll find links to my current resume and a page where I tell you a bit more about my professional journey so far.
