### So, your wondering about me and this site huh? ###

I've always had an interest in technology, even from an early age. Looking back I've found that I'm happiest when working with technology and specifically with computer technology. I consider myself lucky in that I've been able to adapt and reinvent myself over the years. That's allowed me to handle a variety of jobs I've had. Be it from working with microprocessors, managing a network for a small company, machining parts, or working with hydraulic test stands. But my heart is always drawn to working with computers in some way.

On this site you'll be able to learn a little bit about my past and my work experience. While that's nice and all, what I really hope you learn is what I can do, what I'm learning, how I process things, and maybe discover that there is some way we can help each other.

Testing is something I enjoy. A lot of what I've done over the years has involved testing hardware. Luckily because of technology this has often involved using computers to help doing the testing. I've had the chance to use microprocessors to exercise the hardware on industrial controllers and to use computers to gather data on test stands which put mechanical hardware through it's paces. And it's been interesting to say the least. From the simple quick tests to the fights to grab the right data it's been fun.

What's really peaked my interest for a while now is software testing. Breaking hardware is generally not fun but poking and prodding software, that's a different story. I had the opportunity work on a web site to serve up a monthly publication one time. I did a lot of manual testing on that site. Most of it exploratory in as methodical a process as I could. I really enjoyed that would like to do morw work in the area of software quality. And right now, that's what I'm learning more about. 

I've spent some time with databases (mainly MySQL) and just took a course on SQL and PostgreSQL. Currently I'm working on learning Python and also taking a Udemy class on software testing. As I progress on I'll be sharing what I learn here on this site. I'm hoping to post some projects I come up with and pass along what I've learned.

Thanks for stopping by,

John
